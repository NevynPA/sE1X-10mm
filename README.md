# sE1X-10mm
E1X (super) with lulz bed and 10mm smooth rods


First off, thank you Tjb1 for creating the E1X and for LoH's contributions such as making the required modifications to
allow for the Lulzbot 300x300mm heated bed and also for the upgraded 10mm smooth rod designs.

I have made a few modifications that I needed to allow for the lulzbot heated bed build to work on 10mm smooth rods(I was
the first one to actually do this upgrade, I ran int oa few snags..). The first one I ran into was the Y smooth rod holders
seemed to be roughly 2mm shy in the Y axis direction and I could not get the smooth rod to mount properly so I lengthened 
those, worked perfectly for me. Second, The added height from the 10mm smooth rods required a larger Y belt gripper, so I
made a padded version that adds 5mm to it so the belt runs smoothly.

I am selling kits of the sE1X on the Mobious website and will also be selling Crunch filament, along with SMoothieboards.

I have made a new BoM for the sE1X broke down into 3 sections: Hardware - Printed Parts - Fasteners. I will have links
